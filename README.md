Machine learning plays a significant role in medical system as early and accurate detection of disease can save many people lives.Lung disease such as Tuber- culosis (TB) is a chronic infectious disease is a major cause of death worldwide. For the diagnosis, chest x- ray is performed to detect TB. To predict the disease from the patientâ€™s chest x-ray, many machine learning approaches are developed giving decent results. In this project, two small datasets i.e. Montgomery County and Shenzhen dataset are considered. The task performed is detection of tuberculosis disease from the chest x-ray images. I have used feature combination approach for classification. A pipeline is created, the images are first segmented using U-net algorithm and then are classified with feature combination method. In this method features are extracted using VGG-16 and ResNet 50 methods with predefined weights. These extracted features are combined and then are trained on fully connected dense layers. There are 3 different feature combination models are prepared of VGG16, ResNet 50, and InceptionV3. Furthermore, feature combination of CNN + CNN is also performed.
